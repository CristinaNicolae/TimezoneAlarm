I was in an internship at a firm where the clients were from other countries. 
We always had this problem: they usually told us: "We will have a call at 9pm (my time)". 
We spend about a minute to see what time will be in our country. 

Timezonealarm allows you add two different timezones for which you can add alarms. 
They will go off when the hour is that timezone matches with the one on your phone.
