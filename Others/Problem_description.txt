I was in an internship at a firm where the clients were from other countries. 
We always had this problem: they usually told us: "We will have a call at 9pm (my time)". 
We spent about a minute to see what time will be in our country. 

Timezonealarm allows you to add two different timezones for which you can add alarms. 
They will go off when the hour in that timezone matches with the one on your phone. 


When you enter the app you have two preselected timezones. 
You can change them from settings.
For each timezone you can add multiple alarms by rotating the needle to the desired time.
You can remove an alarm by long pressing on it.
